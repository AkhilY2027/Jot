Main Screen Layout - 3 Views: Beginning, Middle, and End
	These will have flex of 1, 3, 1
		Middle will use flexGrow when space is greater
		Start and End will use flexShrink when space is smaller
	Beginning: Will contain Buttons to navigate to different pages
		Could be a later feature but 2 in mind: Notification Settings and Previous Jots
		Use columnGap to ensure space between these two buttons
	Middle: Will contain actual text box to write down the Jot
		Can also have "tags" at end to specify "vibes", "inspiration", etc. - Later feature
	End: Button to Save Jot + Notify User later that Jot exists
Notification Settings Layout - 
Previous Jots Layout - 

Other Additions:

	-Maybe also have a rotation lock feature?
	-First, set orientation in "app.json" to "default" - Must change if we want our app to react to orientation changes
	-Can shift so everything is now horizontal instead of vertical
